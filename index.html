			<h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>1931</strong>: Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.</li>
				<li><strong>1995</strong>: Kalam moved to Madras to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.</li>
				<li>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.</li>
				<li><strong>1963</strong>: In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.</li>
				<li><strong>1965</strong>: Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.</li>
				<li><strong>1969</strong>: In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.</li>
				<li><strong>1970</strong>: Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</li>
				<li><strong>1980</strong>: His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. </li>
				<li><strong>1981</strong>: The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.</li>
				<li><strong>1992</strong>Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. </li>
				<li><strong>1997</strong>In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.</li>
				<li><strong>1998</strong>In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".</li>
				<li><strong>2002</strong>: Kalam became the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.</li>
				<li><strong>2005</strong>: He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.</li>
				<li><strong>2013</strong>: In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project". Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes.</li>
				<li><strong>2015</strong>: On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</li>
